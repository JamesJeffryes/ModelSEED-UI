    <p>ModelSEED Projects is place to share and demonstrate research
        not currently available for use in the ModelSEED resource.
        Sometimes these tools are prototypes for future additions to the ModelSEED and sometimes they are experiments. Sometimes they are  simply supplemental material in an associated paper.</p>
