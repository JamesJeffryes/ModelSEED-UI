The issues here are general, high-level issues.  Usually, these are issues about various workflows or missing service functionality, rather than issues with the UI.

## General Issues

- SHOCK should be updated so that gzipping can be used and/or the Workspace Service should return object data.  Fixing this would speed up object pages about 3x (tested on my connection).

- Unintegration of gapfilling solutions doesn't seem to work, so it was removed from the site.
